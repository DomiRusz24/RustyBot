# RustyBot

![Icon](https://www.domirusz24.pl/img/discordbot.png)

Light discord bot "heartbeat", written in rust. Keeps the bot online, allowing you to preform REST API requests on it. Roughly 1MB per bot, with 1MB of overhead. 

This is not a full fledged discord api wrapper, it's just for keeping the bot online in a light manner, so you can use it in a different project.

## Usage

Linux / Mac / BSD:

> discord-bot -- TOKEN TOKEN TOKEN etc.

Windows:

> discord-bot.exe -- TOKEN TOKEN TOKEN etc.
